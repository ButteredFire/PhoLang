# PhởLang
PhởLang is a full-fledged Vietnamese programming language that aims to open the world of Computer Science to Vietnamese students through its intuitive Vietnamese syntax.

# Motive
I created this language not only to revolutionize contemporary technology education in Vietnam by helping non-English-speaking Vietnamese students understand the core concepts of programming, but also as a practical language that can be used for large-scale projects.
In the ever-changing landscape of technology, the demand for excellent programmers grows increasingly, constituting a call for better education in technology, especially for a developing country such as Vietnam. However, from my experience, technology, to wit programming, has never been taken into serious consideration in many schools, and schools that do teach programming often use obsolescent languages, e.g. Pascal, resulting in the obfuscation of the wonderful world of computer science from many Vietnamese students. 
An issue that Vietnamese students who do learn programming often face is difficulty with learning and/or memorizing English keywords, something prevalently intimidating for those who cannot speak English very well.
This has led me to believe that the solution to this is to create a Vietnamese-based programming language. This will not only help students grasp programming concepts and create various applications within the comfort of their own mother-tongue language, but also act as a powerful tool to prototype large-scale projects that utilize complex elements of a programming language, e.g. scoping, exception handling, object-oriented features, memory management, and multithreading.

> _"I have seen many Vietnamese-based programming languages before. How is this any different?"_

I believe that what sets PhởLang apart from other Vietnamese-based programming languages is its features. Most of the aforementioned languages are purely experimental/conceptual, whereas this language is full-fledged - complete with essential features that constitute a modern programming language (e.g. well-defined syntax, datatypes, operators/expressions, control structures, functions/procedures, scoping, memory management, I/O, exception handling, object-oriented features, concurrency/multithreading).
For schools that still use outdated programming languages, PhởLang, I believe, can bridge the gap by offering a modern, relevant alternative.

# VPL's syntax
## Striking a balance between convention and intuitiveness
VPL has conventions commonly seen in most programming languages, e.g. declaring header files first, being a strongly-typed language, having a ```main()``` function, using curly braces to determine scopes, using semicolons, etc.
Because these conventions might be overwhelming to novice programmers, VPL is made with intuitiveness in mind, reducing as many symbols as possible to avoid being cryptic while still maintaining certain conventions, like the use of curly braces. To elaborate on the latter, VPL is made to resemble most programming languages, as opposed to Python (wherein, for instance, scopes are determined by indentation, and semicolons are optional)
